# Interplanetary Trajectory Planning
This repo contains the code for handling interplanetary trajectory planning for rendez-vous mission in the solar system.
The scenarios are generated using data from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA and handled used the `jplephem` package. Description of the package and the data source are detailed [here](https://pypi.org/project/jplephem/).

The scripts are implementations of **Monte Carlo Tree Search** based algorithms.

We also use data from the Global Trajectory Optimization Problem [portal](https://sophia.estec.esa.int/gtoc_portal/) previous competitions.
